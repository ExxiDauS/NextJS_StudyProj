# JSX File
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar  _HTML-like_  syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following  [three JSX rules](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-rules-of-jsx), you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.

But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.
## TLDR
JSX = syntax expansion for JS allows you to describe UI in JS
but it needs compiler like " **Babel** " to make browser understand JSX file type.
